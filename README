print("Hi guys. I'm so new to this. BTW I've just realized that my account is 4 years old, I couldn't remember I already joined the community. I have nothing to do with programming, but I started learning Python while in quarantine, and I want to do some exciting projects for beginners. I also like webprogramming; HTML5, PHP, JavaScript. Once I get bored with my current job, would be awesome to do such thing.")
